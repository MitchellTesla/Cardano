## :warning: Disclaimer 

This is prototypical and exploratory work shared here for your interest. 
Although we might create a prototype for a `hydra-node` in here, some 
experiments have not a clear goal or usage in mind. We do not provide 
documentation or support for the artifacts created here by purpose as we 
also intend to throw away / discontinue use when we start building the
final product. Please note the code quality seen around here is not 
representative of our best practices and you will find many code smells 
and dirtyhacks. Thanks for visiting and enjoy!

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Development

We provide a `shell.nix` to set up a development environment. So a simple call
to `nix-shell` should put everything in place for building, testing and
general development.

Make sure the following caches are listed in your `nix.conf` for a speedy setup:

```
substituters = https://cache.nixos.org https://iohk.cachix.org https://hydra.iohk.io
trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY= iohk.cachix.org-1:DpRUyj7h7V830dp/i6Nti+NEO2/nhblbov/8MW7Rqoo= hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ=
```

Also, some of us use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and
[nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) to automatically
import the nix-shell environment into our favorite shell or editor.

### Building & Testing

`cabal build` and `cabal test` should work as expected
